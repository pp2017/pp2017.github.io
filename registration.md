hotbed for recreational activities. The dramatic, rugged landscape features
volcanic craters, caves, lava fields, geothermal waters, and hot springs, in
addition to a variety of restaurants, museums, churches, lighthouses, and
festivals.  Dinner will be at Salthúsið in Grindavík an old fisherman village.
