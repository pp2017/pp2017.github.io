travelers from personal border controls between 22 EU countries. For residents
outside the Schengen area, a valid passport is required for at least three
months beyond date of entry. For information on passport and visa requirements
as well as the Schengen area regulations, visit the website of the Icelandic
Directorate of Immigration: [www.utl.is][utl].

#Arrival in Iceland

Bus services are operated between Reykjavík and Keflavík International Airport
in connection with all arriving and departing flights, and seats are guaranteed.

airport and Reykjavík takes about 45 minutes. For departing flights, it is
recommended that you take a bus leaving at least 2.5 hours before your scheduled
departure. It is possible to arrange a hotel pickup. Taxi services are available

#Driving in Iceland

Ring Road Nr. 1 around Iceland is 1,332 km (827 mi). The general speed limit is
50 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h on gravel roads in rural areas, and 90 km/h on
asphalt, rural roads. Major highways are paved. Most mountain roads are closed
until the end of June, or even longer, because of snow and muddy conditions,
which make them impassable. For more information, be sure to visit
[www.safetravel.is][safetravel]. Most roads in the interior of Iceland have a loose gravel
surface, which is especially loose along the sides of the roads. The mountain
roads are quite narrow and are not made for speeding. The same goes for some
bridges that will only let one car cross at a time. Information on road
conditions, tel.: +522-1000, daily 8:00–16:00. [www.road.is][roads].

All off-road driving and driving outside of marked tracks is prohibited by law.
Icelandic nature is delicate and tire tracks from off-road driving can cause
substantial damage to the vegetation and leave marks that will last for decades.
Respect the nature and tread carefully. For some mountain tracks it is strongly
advised that two or more cars travel together. Passengers in the front and
backseats of an automobile are required by law to use safety-belts. Icelandic
law forbids any driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while talking
on a mobile phone is also banned.

#National Parks

There are three National Parks in Iceland, each with its own particular points
of interest. Thingvellir, is in a rift valley between the North Atlantic and
Eurasian Plates. It is a site of historical and cultural as well as of
geological importance, and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Snæfellsjökull National Park includes a volcano and glacier, and is steeped in
mystery and romance; it is the only Park that reaches from the seashore to the
mountaintops. Vatnajökull National Park is the largest national park in Europe,
covering an area of 13.600 km2. The park encompasses, among other areas, the
Vatnajökull glacier, Skaftafell, Jökulsárgljúfur, Lakagígar and Langisjór.

#Climate and clothing

Thanks to the Gulf Stream, Iceland enjoys a cool, temperate maritime climate;
cool in summer and fairly mild in winter. The month of June is characterized by
gradually rising daily high temperatures – some would even say warm days! As for
the actual temperatures, you can expect the average low to be approximately 5.5
degrees Celsius (42 F) and the average high temperatures to be 12.8 degrees
Celsius (55 F). Keep in mind that these are averages. You could get lucky and
have warmer days. But, in general life at this latitude means dealing with cool
temperatures, even in June. By the end of June the length of day is almost 21
hours. For weather information in English, tel.: 902-0600.
